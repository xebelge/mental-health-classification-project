# Mental Health Classification Project

## Project Description
This project aims to classify mental health conditions using both supervised (Logistic Regression) and unsupervised learning techniques (K-means Clustering). The dataset includes various mental health statuses, and different algorithms were applied to understand which method performs better.

## Algorithms Used:
- **Logistic Regression (Supervised Learning)**: Achieved an accuracy of 77%, showing strong performance in labeled text classification tasks.
- **K-means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)**: While clusters were formed, the unsupervised method struggled to match the performance of Logistic Regression.

## Final Results and Comparison:
- **Logistic Regression** performed better due to the labeled nature of the dataset, achieving a weighted accuracy of 77%.
- **K-means** provided useful visual groupings but was less effective for classification tasks with this dataset.

This dataset was more suited for **supervised learning**, as it had predefined labels that helped the model train effectively.
