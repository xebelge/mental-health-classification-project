# Mental Health Classification Project

## Project Description
This project aims to classify mental health conditions using both supervised (Logistic Regression) and unsupervised (K-means Clustering) learning techniques. The dataset includes various mental health statuses, and both algorithms were applied to evaluate their performance.

## Algorithms Used:
- **Logistic Regression (Supervised Learning)**: Achieved an accuracy of 77%, demonstrating strong performance in labeled text classification tasks.
- **K-means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)**: Clusters were formed, but this method struggled compared to Logistic Regression due to the lack of labels.

## Final Results and Comparison:
- **Logistic Regression** performed significantly better, with an accuracy of 77%, showing strong performance in distinguishing between labeled mental health statuses.
- **K-means Clustering** provided useful visual groupings but underperformed due to the datasetâ€™s need for labeled data, which better suits supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression.

This dataset was more suited for **supervised learning**, given the predefined labels available for training.
